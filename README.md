# Lucas Number Series with Static Code Analysis using Pylint

This repository contains the Python script to compute the **Lucas number (Ln)** based on the given recurrence relation. The project also includes the use of **Pylint** to perform static code analysis and improve the code by addressing the recommended changes.

## Problem Description

The Lucas number series is defined as follows:
- \( L_0 = -3 \)
- \( L_1 = -1 \)
- For \( n > 1 \), the sequence follows the recurrence relation:
  \[
  L_n = L_{n-1} + L_{n-2}
  \]

The task is to write a Python script that:
1. Takes an integer `n` as input (where \( 1 < n < 1000001 \)).
2. Returns the corresponding Lucas number \( L_n \).

### Example:
- Input: `n = 2`
- Output: `L2 = -4`

The script also includes **Pylint** for static code analysis to improve code quality. After running the Pylint tool and making necessary changes, the scriptâ€™s lint score is recorded.


## Script Description

### `lucas_number.py`

This script implements the following steps:
1. **Input Handling:** Takes an integer `n` as input from the user.
2. **Lucas Number Calculation:** Uses the recurrence relation to calculate the Lucas number \( L_n \) based on the input `n`.
3. **Output:** Prints the corresponding Lucas number \( L_n \).
